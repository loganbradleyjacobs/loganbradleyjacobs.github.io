## Overview
This is a quick write-up about "Easy-Get", a crackme found on [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/).

I began this crackme by trying to decompile the executable, as I had done before for less involved problems, using a [decompiler explorer](https://dogbolt.org/). Unfortunately, I got the following message: `Error decompiling: Exceeded time limit`. I hadn't encountered this before, but I had a few ideas of what could be causing this.
1. There is intentional obfuscation. The difficulty of this crackme was a 3.0, which was higher than the others that I had tried. This, and the fact that the executable was stripped of its symbols and debugging information.
2. This is a red herring. Somehow, the user code that was being executed when I ran the file was buried around lots of boilerplate code. 

I had to get some information on the file first, so I ran: `ls -lh LOL` (LOL is the name of the executable... hilarious.) I got the following output:
```
> ls -lh LOL
-rwxrwxr-x@ 1 loganjacobs  staff   420K Jul 21  2018 LOL
```
This told me the executable had full permissions for everyone, only one hard link, that I was the owner, the group was `staff`, the file was 420K kilobytes and that it was created July 21st, 2018.
This is all well and good, but I needed to see more about this file and how I can run it, which is a perfect opportunity for the `file` command.
```
> file LOL
LOL: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
```
